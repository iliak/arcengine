Spells Per Level 
Clerics and Wizards gain new spells at levels 1,3,5, and 7. You don't get to choose what spells Clerics recieve, because they are "divined" them.

Here is the amount of spells a Wizard or Cleric would be able to memorize w/o the Wisdom or Intelligence bonus:

    Cleric Level    Lvl 0   Lvl 1   Lvl 2   Lvl 3   Lvl 4

Cleric Spells 
Level 0 Spells:

Cure Minor Wounds
Range: Touch
Duration: Action
Description: Cures 1 HP
Overview: This is an extremely weak healing spell. At higher levels, using a round to heal just one hp isn't very useful, especially when your figthers will have dozens of hitpoints.

Inflict Minor Wounds
Range: Touch
Duration: Action
Description: Inflict 1 HP
Overview: Very weak damage spell. 1 HP of damage is miniscule, and doesn't even have much use very early in the game.

Resistance
Range: Touch
Duration: Minutes
Description: Makes target stronger against magic attack
Overview: A mediocre spell, this can be useful if you are facing several magic users, but the effect is minimal and the duration is too low for the spell to be very effective.

Virtue
Range: Touch
Duration: Minutes
Description: Subject gains 1 temporary HP
Overview: Better than Cure Minor Wounds because you can raise the HP of a character over their normal limit but it still isn't very useful.
 
Cleric Spells
Level 1 Spells:

Bane
Range: Personal
Duration: Minutes
Description: Fill enemies with doubt
Overview: A fairly useful spell, but it is limited by it's short duration and short range.

Bless
Range: Personal
Duration: Minutes
Description: Fills allies with courage
Overview: Good spell, but it doesn't last very long.

Cause Fear
Range: Close
Duration: Round
Description: Fill enemies with fear
Overview: Not that useful because of the limited range and short
duration.

Cure Light Wounds
Range: Close
Duration: Round
Description: Cures 1-6 HP (+1 for every level)
Overview: A very good basic healing spell, especially useful at higher levels. Devote several memorization slots to this spell.

Doom
Range: Medium
Duration: Minutes
Description: Fill target with dread
Overview: Fairly useful, but not that effective.

Inflict Light Wounds
Range: Touch
Duration: Action
Description: Inflicts 1-6 level damage (+1 for every level)
Overview: One of the Cleric's variety of damaging spells, this one is a poor selection because of its very small range. Don't use this spell unless your cleric is being used as a fighter.

Protection from Chaos
Range: Touch
Duration: Minutes
Description: Wards attacks from chaotic creatures
Overview: All of the protection spells aren't very useful, especially since it is hard to tell whether an enemy is chaotic, evil, good, or lawful.

Protection from Evil
Range: Touch
Duration: Minutes
Description: Wards attacks from evil creatures
Overview: All of the protection spells aren't very useful, especially since it is hard to tell whether an enemy is chaotic, evil, good, or lawful.

Protection from Good
Range: Touch
Duration: Minutes
Description: Wards attacks from good creatures
Overview: All of the protection spells aren't very useful, especially since it is hard to tell whether an enemy is chaotic, evil, good, or lawful.

Protection from Law
Range: Touch
Duration: Minutes
Description: Wards attacks from lawful creatures
Overview: All of the protection spells aren't very useful, especially since it is hard to tell whether an enemy is chaotic, evil, good, or lawful.

Remove Fear
Range: Close
Duration: Minutes
Description: Cures allies inflicted with fear
Overview: A fairly useful spell, but I would only memorize it if you know that the enemy you are about to face likes to cast Cause Fear on your characters.

Shield of Faith
Range: Touch
Duration: Minutes
Description: Makes target harder to hit (+2 AC)
Overview: Not terribly useful, but it could save your fighters if they have very low armor classes.
 



Wizard Spells
Level 2 Spells:

Aganazzar's Scorcher
Range: Close
Duration: Action
Description: Fire stream causing 1-11 damage
Overview: A fairly weak damage spell, this spell is fairly useful early on. It shoots out a stream of fire, so don't cast this spell through your teammates because you will hurt them too.

Blur
Range: Touch
Duration: Minutes
Description: Makes target harder to hit
Overview: Don't worry yourself with this spell. It's fairly useful, but the duration is too short.

Bull's Strength
Range: Touch
Duration: Hours
Description: Adds 2-5 Strength
Overview: Can be useful, especially if you'd like to do more damage with a specific character or need a boost of strength to open a tough door.

Cat's Grace
Range: Touch
Duration: Hours
Description: Adds 2-5 Dexterity
Overview: A fairly good spell, but not worth memorizing or even learning because of it's limited use.

Eagle's Splendor
Range: Touch
Duration: Hours
Desciption: Adds 2-5 Charisma
Overview: A fairly good spell, but not worth memorizing or even learning because of it's limited use.

Endurance
Range: Touch
Duration: Hours
Description: Adds 2-5 Constitution
Overview: A fairly good spell, but not worth memorizing or even learning because of it's limited use.

Gedlee's Electric Loop
Range: Close
Duration: Action
Desciption: 1-18 points of damage in a 5 ft. radius
Overview: Be careful with this spell, it's short range might force you to hurt your teammates if you want to use this spell. I would forgo this spell.

Ghoul Touch
Range: Touch
Duration: Round
Desciption: Paralyzes target
Overview: Really only useful if your wizard is in the front lines fighting your opponents in hand-to-hand combat, which should NOT be happening.

Knock
Range: Medium
Duration: Action
Description: Opens locked, stuck, and barred doors
Overview: A good spell if your rogues and warriors can't bust down a specific door, otherwise, don't have this spell memorized. If you play correctly, at least one of your rogues should have a high enough open lock skill to open most doors.

Melf's Acid Arrow
Range: Long
Duration: Round
Desciption: Arrow which does 2-8 damage
Overview: Not a very good spell. The distance at which you can hit enemies with this spell is impressive, unfortunately the damage is poor.

Scare
Range: Medium
Duration: Round
Desciption: More powerful than Cause Fear
Overview: Fairly useful. Use it if it seems to help you win battles, otherwise just don't use it. I personally don't like any of the Cause Fear spells.

Snilloc's Snowball Swarm
Range: Medium
Duration: Action
Description: Snow erupts from target, 2-24 damage area
Overview: A very good damage spell (except against skeletons), which can damage several creatures at once. The radius of this spell is 2.

Web
Range: Medium
Duration: Round
Desciption: Entangles creatures making it harder to fight
Overview: If your characters have ever been "webbed", you would realize why this spell is a poor choice. It does very little to hamper combat skills.
 
Wizard Spells
Level 3 Spells:

Dispel Magic
Range: Medium
Duration: Action
Desciption: Cancels magical effects
Overview: A very useful utility spell to help rid your characters
of a variety of aliments. I wouldn't recommend learning it with a wizard though. Let your Cleric cast this spell.

Fireball
Range: Long
Duration: Action
Desciption: 1-6 fire damage per caster level in a large area
Overview: One of the best damaging spells in this game. The damage is awesome and the radius of the blast is huge (5). Be careful when using this potent spell, it's very easy to accidently hurt your own characters.

Flame Arrow
Range: Medium
Duration: Action
Desciption: Shoots a fiery bolt for 4-24 points of damage
Overview: Not as good as the other level 3 damage spells that the wizard can use.

Hold Person
Range: Medium
Duration: Round
Desciption: Makes target stand helpless
Overview: Limited use = unnecessary.

Lightning Bolt
Range: Medium
Duration: Action
Desciption: 1-6 lightning damage per caster level.
Overview: Another great level 3 damage spell, I would recommend using this frequently on tough opponents. At level 7, you could potentially do 56 damage!

Stinking Cloud
Range: Medium
Duration: Round
Desciption: Nauseates targets in the cloud
Overview: If you can shoot the cloud so that your characters are not effected, this spell can aid your fighters substantially.

Vampiric Touch
Range: Touch
Duration: Action
Desciption: Caster gains 1-6 damage every two caster levels 
Overview: I wouldn't learn this, but that's because I don't use my wizard in the front lines. If you for some reason enjoy fighting in melee combat with your wizard, this spell may be for you.
