Measurement Conventions

ArcEngine uses a variety of units of measurement with which you
should be familiar when setting properties, particularly those relating to
character behavior.


Distance
Distance is measured in pixels. Appropriate distance-related properties can
often be determined by considering the dimensions of the screen. For example,
if the screen width is 1024 pixels, then a character's Maximum Viewing Distance
would need to be about 512 in order for him to be able to see the player from
halfway across the screen.


Time
Time is measured in units called ticks. There are normally 30 ticks per second.
Accordingly, games created with ArcEngine normally display 30
frames per second (though the frame rate may decrease on slower computers.)
Ticks are often used to measure delays between events that occur repeatedly.
Note that although the number of ticks per second is assumed to be 30, this value
can be changed by adjusting the Target Frame Rate.


Speed
An object's speed is measured in pixels of movement per tick. Since there are
normally 30 ticks per second, an entity moving at a speed of 15 pixels per
tick is able to travel 450 pixels per second.


Acceleration
Acceleration is an expression of the increase in an object's speed over time. If an
entity has a horizontal acceleration of 1, then his speed will be increased by 1 pixel 
every timer tick. After a second, he would be moving at a rate of 30 pixels per tick.

Sound Volume
The volume of most sounds is determined by the game engine, which
compares the location of the sound's origin to the camera location. A sound
being emitted by an object located at the center of the screen will be louder
than one being produced by an object near the side of the screen. It is possible
for a user-designed routine to change the volume of a level's background
music. In that case, the sound's volume can be set to any value between 100
(loudest) and 0 (inaudible.)
